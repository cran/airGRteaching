#' dygraph series group
#' 
#' Add a data series group to a dygraph plot. Note that options will use the default 
#' global setting (as determined by \code{\link{dyOptions}}) when not specified 
#' explicitly. Importantly, any dySeries options passed can be passed as a vector of values 
#' and will be replicated across all series named as part of the group. If arguments differ in
#' length than the number of series named, then the argument vector will be 
#' cycled across the named series.
#' 
#' NOTE: dyGroup will turn off \code{stackedGraph}, as the option will calculated cumulatives using
#' all series in the underlying dygraph, not just a subset.
#' 
#' The dyGroup function can also replicated similar arguments across multiple series, or 
#' be used to apply a grouped custom plotter - i.e., multi-column plotter - to a subset of the
#' dygraph data series.
#' 
#' @inheritParams dySeries
#' @inheritParams dyOptions
#'   
#' @param dygraph Dygraph to add a series definition to
#' @param name character vector of the series within data set. If no name is specified then 
#'   series are bound to implicitly based on their order within the underlying 
#'   time series object. This parameter can also be a character vector of length
#'   3 that specifies a set of input column names to use as the lower, value,
#'   and upper for a series with a shaded bar drawn around it.
#' @param label Labels to display for series (uses name if no label defined)
#' @param color Colors for series. These can be of the form "#AABBCC" or 
#'   "rgb(255,100,200)" or "yellow", etc. Note that if you specify a custom 
#'   color for one series then you must specify one for all series. If not 
#'   specified then the global colors option (typically based on equally-spaced 
#'   points around a color wheel). Note also that global and per-series color 
#'   specification cannot be mixed.
#' @param axis Y-axis to associate the series with ("y" or "y2")
#' @param stepPlot When set, display the graph as a step plot instead of a line 
#'   plot.
#' @param stemPlot When set, display the graph as a stem plot instead of a line
#'   plot.
#' @param fillGraph Should the area underneath the graph be filled? This option 
#'   is not compatible with error bars.
#' @param drawPoints Draw a small dot at each point, in addition to a line going
#'   through the point. This makes the individual data points easier to see, but
#'   can increase visual clutter in the chart.
#' @param pointSize The size of the dot to draw on each point in pixels. A dot 
#'   is always drawn when a point is "isolated", i.e. there is a missing point 
#'   on either side of it. This also controls the size of those dots.
#' @param pointShape The shape of the dot to draw. Can be one of the following:
#'   "dot" (default), "triangle", "square", "diamond", "pentagon", "hexagon",
#'   "circle", "star", "plus" or "ex".
#' @param strokeWidth The width of the lines connecting data points. This can be
#'   used to increase the contrast or some graphs.
#' @param strokePattern A predefined stroke pattern type ("dotted", "dashed", or
#'   "dotdash") or a custom pattern array where the even index is a draw and odd
#'   is a space in pixels. If \code{NULL} then it draws a solid line. The array 
#'   should have an even length as any odd length array could be expressed as 
#'   a smaller even length array.
#' @param strokeBorderWidth Draw a border around graph lines to make crossing 
#'   lines more easily distinguishable. Useful for graphs with many lines.
#' @param strokeBorderColor Color for the line border used if 
#'   \code{strokeBorderWidth} is set.
#' 
#' @param plotter A function which plots the series group. See the 
#'   \href{http://dygraphs.com/tests/plotters.html}{dygraphs documentation} for 
#'   additional details on plotting functions.
#'   
#' @return Dygraph with additional series

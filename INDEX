
Modelling functions:
====================

PrepGR                  Creation of the inputs required to the CalGR
                        and SimGR functions
CalGR                   Calibration algorithm optimises the error
                        criterion selected as objective function
SimGR                   Run GR hydrological models
						
						
Plotting functions:
====================	
					
dyplot                  Interactive time series plotting of PrepGR, CalGR
                        and SimGR objects
plot.PrepGR             Time series plotting GR objects from inputs
plot.CalGR              Plotting of the evolution of parameters and
                        objective function during the calibration step,
                        and time series plotting GR objects from calibration
                        outputs

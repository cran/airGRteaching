## Overview

airGRteaching is an add-on package to the [airGR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=airGR) package that simplifies its use and is teaching-oriented.
It allows to use with very low programming skills the rainfall-runoff models (**GR4H**, **GR5H**, **GR4J**, **GR5J**, **GR6J**, **GR2M**, **GR1A**) and a snow melt and accumulation model (CemaNeige). This package also provides graphical devices to help students to explore data and modelling results.

The airGRteaching package has been designed to fulfil a major requirement: facilitating the use of the [airGR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=airGR) functionalities by students. The names of the functions and their arguments were chosen to this end. 

The package is mostly based on three families of functions:

- the functions that allow to complete very simply a hydrological modelling exercise;
- plotting functions to help students to explore observed data and to interpret the results of calibration and simulation of the GR models;
- a function which runs a 'Shiny' graphical interface that allows for displaying in real-time model parameters impacts on hydrographs.

This package brings into R the hydrological modelling tools developed at INRAE-Antony ([Catchment Hydrology research group](https://webgr.inrae.fr/en/home/) of the HYCAR Research Unit, France).


## Installation

``` r
install.packages("airGRteaching")
```

This version of airGRteaching is designed to work with the package htmlwidgets >= 1.5.2.9000 (troubles with the package dygraphs using `dyplot()` and `ShinyGR()`)
Install the latest version of 'htmlwidgets' from GitHub with the following command lines:

``` {r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ramnathv/htmlwidgets")
``` 


## Modelling Functions

Three functions allow to complete very simply a hydrological modelling exercise:

- preparation of data: `PrepGR()`;
- calibration of the models: `CalGR()`;
- simulation with the models: `SimGR()`.



## Plotting Functions

airGRteaching provides two types of plotting functions that allow to produce static (`plot()`) or dynamic (`dyplot()`) graphics (incl. mouse events and interactive graphics).
The devices allow to explore observed data and to interpret the results of calibration and simulation of the GR models.



## Shiny interface

The package also provides the `ShinyGR()` function, which allows to run a Shiny interface. Thus its is possible to perform:

- interactive flow simulations with parameters modifications;
- automatic calibration;
- display of internal variables evolution;
- time period selection.

A demonstrator of the graphical interface is available for free online on the [Sunshine website](https://sunshine.irstea.fr/).


## Models

The six hydrological models and the snow melt and accumulation model already available in airGR are available in airGRteaching.
These models can be called within airGRteaching using the following model names: 

- `GR4H`: four-parameter hourly lumped hydrological model (Mathevet, 2005)
- `GR5H`: five-parameter hourly lumped hydrological model (Ficchi, 2017; Ficchi *et al.*, 2019)
- `GR4J`&#42;: four-parameter daily lumped hydrological model (Perrin et al., 2003)
- `GR5J`&#42;: five-parameter daily lumped hydrological model (Le Moine, 2008)
- `GR6J`&#42;: six-parameter daily lumped hydrological model (Pushpalatha et al., 2011)
- `GR2M`: two-parameter monthly lumped hydrological model (Mouelhi, 2003; Mouelhi et al., 2006a)
- `GR1A`: one-parameter annual lumped hydrological model (Mouelhi, 2003; Mouelhi et al., 2006b)
- `CemaNeige`: two-parameter degree-day snow melt and accumulation daily model (combined with GR4H, GR5H, GR4J, GR5J or GR6J) (Valéry et al., 2014)
&#42;: available in the Shiny interface.

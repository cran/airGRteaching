	abstract = {Low flows are seasonal phenomena and an integral component of the flow regime of any river. Because of increased competition between water uses, the demand for forecasts of low-flow periods is rising. But how low-flow predictions should be evaluated? This article focuses on the criteria able to evaluate the efficiency of hydrological models in simulating low flows. Indeed, a variety of criteria have been proposed, but their suitability for the evaluation of low-flow simulations has not been systematically assessed.

Here a range of efficiency criteria advised for low flows is analysed. The analysis mainly concentrates on criteria computed on continuous simulations that include all model errors. The criteria were evaluated using two rainfall–runoff models and a set of 940 catchments located throughout France. In order to evaluate the capacity of each criterion to discriminate low-flow errors specifically, we looked for the part of the hydrograph that carries most of the weight in the criterion computation.

Contrary to what was expected, our analysis revealed that, in most of the existing criteria advised for low flows, high flows still make a significant contribution to the criterion’s value. We therefore recommend using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency criterion calculated on inverse flow values, a valuable alternative to the classically used criteria, in that on average it allows focusing on the lowest 20\% of flows over the study period.},

The value of 27 PE models was assessed in terms of streamflow simulation efficiency over a large sample of 308 catchments located in France, Australia and the United States.

While trying to identify which atmospheric variables were the most relevant to compute PE as input to rainfall–runoff models, we showed that the formulae based on temperature and radiation tend to provide the best streamflow simulations. Surprisingly, PE approaches based on the Penman approach seem less advantageous to feed rainfall–runoff models.

This investigation has resulted in a proposal for a temperature-based PE model, combining simplicity and efficiency, and adapted to four rainfall–runoff models. This PE model only requires mean air temperature (derived from long-term averages) and leads to a slight but steady improvement in rainfall–runoff model efficiency.},

As a consequence, models proposed 20-30 years ago still keep evolving as progress is made in the understanding of catchment hydrological behaviour. Here we present the GR4J model, a daily lumped rainfall-runoff model which is the result of a continuous improvement process over the last 15 years. The article provides the mathematical formulation of a new four-parameter version of the model. Model performance is assessed on a large sample of catchments: compared to other rainfall-runoff models, the GR4J performance is among the best ones. It also gives better results than the previous three-parameter model version, especially in the simulation of low flows. The tests indicate that a four-parameter structure corresponds to the maximum level of complexity that could be afforded in the model. Adding more free parameters did not bring significant improvements. The gain in model robustness with this new version should enhance the confidence in the practical use of this simple model for water engineering and resource management. The discussion underlines the potential limits introduced in the modelling process when one relies on a priori concepts in building a model structure and it stresses the value of large catchment samples to assess models.},

	abstract = {The Durance River is one of the major rivers located in the Southern part of France. Water resources are under high pressure due to significant abstractions for various water uses (irrigation, hydropower, drinking water, industries, recreation and ecological services) within and out of the river basin. The water management with the Durance River basin will have to face global change that may question the sustainability of the current rules for water allocation. A chain of models was developed to simulate climate at regional scale (given by 3300 projections obtained by applying three downscaling methods), water resources (provided by six rainfall-runoff models forced by a subset of 330 climate projections), water demand for agriculture and water supply for domestic purposes for different sub-basins of the Durance River basin upstream of Mallemort under present-day and future conditions. A model of water management was developed to simulate reservoir operations for the three main dams (Serre-Pon�on, Castillon, Sainte-Croix) on present-day conditions. This model simulates water releases from reservoir under constraints imposed by rule curves, ecological flows downstream to the dams and water levels in summer for recreational purposes. Four territorial socio-economic scenarios were also elaborated with the help of stake holders to project water needs in the 2050s for the areas supplied with water diverted from the Durance River basin. Results suggest: - a projected increase of the average air temperature with consequences on snow accumulation and melt processes; - no significant trends in total precipitation; - a decrease in snowpack, which will lead to reduced flows, especially in the spring season; - a decrease in water resources in summer; - an increase of pressure on water resources; - a decrease in water demand for irrigation as a consequence of the socio economics scenarios; - a decrease in energy produced by the main dams in the Durance River basin in the 2050s mainly due to reduced annual inflows; - a full compliance with water needs for priority uses downstream the reservoir but a lower flexibility for hydropower management during winter peak energy demand. / Une vision prospective de la gestion de l\&\#8217;eau du bassin de la Durance et des territoires aliment�s par ses eaux � l\&\#8217;horizon 2050 a �t� �labor�e, appuy�e par une chaine de mod�les.

Two sources of uncertainty were considered: (i) the dependence of the optimal parameter set on the climate characteristics of the calibration period and (ii) the use of several posterior parameter sets over a given calibration period. The first source of uncertainty often refers to the lack of model robustness, while the second one refers to parameter uncertainty estimation based on Bayesian inference. Two rainfall-runoff models were tested on 89 catchments in northern and central France. The two sources of uncertainty were assessed in the past observed period and in future climate conditions. The results show that, given the evaluation approach followed here, the lack of robustness was the major source of variability in streamflow projections in future climate conditions for the two models tested. The hydrological projections generated by an ensemble of posterior parameter sets are close to those associated with the optimal set. Therefore, it seems that greater effort should be invested in improving the robustness of models for climate change impact studies, especially by developing more suitable model structures and proposing calibration procedures that increase their robustness.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the degree of complexity required in a snow accounting routine to ultimately simulate flows at the catchment outlet. We present a simple, parsimonious and general snow accounting routine (SAR), called Cemaneige, that can be associated with any precipitation–runoff model to simulate discharge at the catchment scale. To get results of general applicability, this SAR was tested on a large set of 380 catchments from four countries (France, Switzerland, Sweden and Canada) and combined with four different hydrological models.
Our results show that five basic features provide a good reliability and robustness to the SAR, namely considering: (1) a transition range of temperature for the determination of the solid fraction of precipitation; (2) five altitudinal bands of equal area for snow accumulation; (3) the cold-content of the snowpack (with a parameter controlling snowpack inertia); (4) a degree-day factor controlling snowmelt; (5) uneven snow distribution in each band. This general SAR includes two internal states (the snowpack and its cold-content). Results also indicate that only two free parameters (here snowmelt factor and cold-content factor) are warranted in a SAR at the daily time step and that further complexity is not supported by improvements in flow simulation efficiency.
To justify the reasons for considering the five features above, a sensitivity analysis comparing Cemaneige with other SAR versions is performed. It analyses the snow processes which should be selected or not to bring significant improvement in model performances.
Compared with the six existing SARs presented in the companion article (Valéry et al., this issue) on the 380 catchments set, Cemaneige shows better performance on average than five of these six SARs. It provides performance similar to the sixth SAR (MORD4) but with only half its number of free parameters. However, CemaNeige still appears perfectible on mountainous catchments (France and Switzerland) where the lumped SAR, MORD4, outperforms Cemaneige.
Cemaneige can easily be adapted for simulation on ungauged catchments: fixing its two parameters to default values much less degrades performances than the other best performing SAR. This may partly due to the Cemaneige parsimony.},

Here, we present a diagnostically interesting decomposition of NSE (and hence MSE), which facilitates analysis of the relative importance of its different components in the context of hydrological modelling, and show how model calibration problems can arise due to interactions among these components. The analysis is illustrated by calibrating a simple conceptual precipitation-runoff model to daily data for a number of Austrian basins having a broad range of hydro-meteorological characteristics. Evaluation of the results clearly demonstrates the problems that can be associated with any calibration based on the NSE (or MSE) criterion. While we propose and test an alternative criterion that can help to reduce model calibration problems, the primary purpose of this study is not to present an improved measure of model performance. Instead, we seek to show that there are systematic problems inherent with any optimization based on formulations related to the MSE. The analysis and results have implications to the manner in which we calibrate and evaluate environmental models; we discuss these and suggest possible ways forward that may move us towards an improved and diagnostically meaningful approach to model performance evaluation and identification.},

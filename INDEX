Modelling functions:
======================

PrepGR          Creation of the inputs required to the CalGR
                and SimGR functions
CalGR           Calibration algorithm optimises the error
                criterion selected as objective function
SimGR           Run GR hydrological models


Summarizing functions:
======================

as.data.frame   Create a data.frame from outputs of PrepGR,
                CalGR or SimGR


Plotting functions:
======================	
					
dyplot          Interactive plots for time series of PrepGR, CalGR
                and SimGR objects
plot            Static plots for time series of PrepGR, CalGR
                and SimGR objects. Also plot of the evolution 
                of parameters and objective function during 
                the calibration step for CalGR object


Shiny interface:
======================
ShinyGR         Interactive Web applications to run the GR2M, GR4J, GR5J
                and GR6J hydrological models whith or without CemaNeige
